**Read before starting**
It's a good idea to use a config.properties file to use for database connection. This would contain your database url, username, and password. I added a .gitignore file that would help you ignore this when pushing changes to the repository.

For me I will be using the employeedata table we created from our labs as it has all required primary/foreign key connections. Now not sure about whether or not it contains sample data. Yea it doesn’t so we will need to add that. Read the message regarding the use of an online database or stick to using the databases of our computers. If we do the former, we will only need to upload sample data once. If we do the latter each person has to make sure to upload sample data using the employeedata database from our labs (not 2 or 3 unless you want to reapply foregn/primary key connections).

**File by File tasks**


***Due April 18th***

Employee.java
- Create class with private fields matching database columns (Refer to assignment doc and past labs sql diagrams)
- Add constructor, getters, and setters
- Add toString() method for easy printing

employees 
empID (PK), Fname, Lname, email, HireDate, Salary, SSN, addressID



User.java
- Create class with fields for logged-in user
- Choose approach: String or inner enum for role

Option A (String):

private int empID;
private String username;
private String role;  // "HR_ADMIN" or "GENERAL_EMPLOYEE"

Option B (Inner enum):

public enum Role { HR_ADMIN, GENERAL_EMPLOYEE }
private int empID;
private String username;
private Role role;


***Due April 19th***

DataAccessLayer.java
- Dependencies: Employee.java
- Establish MySQL connection
- Implement CRUD operations
  - findEmployeeBy methods using DOB, SSN, empid editable for HR
  - findEmployeeBy methods using DOB, SSN, empid viewable only for general employee
  - Add AUTO_INCREMENT to empID and payID
  - If you’re using employeedata it should contain necessary foreign key and primary key connections. 
  - Add login credentials to employees if needed, email for username, and a simple password
  - Add sample data for testing.

Methods to implement (Create or look to see from past labs if they are already created). Add on as needed.

connect()
Open database connection

disconnect()
Close connection

findEmployeeById(int empID)
Search by empID → returns Employee

findEmployeeByName(String name)
Search by name → returns List<Employee>

insertEmployee(Employee emp)
Add new employee

updateEmployee(int empID, Employee data)
Update employee

deleteEmployee(int empID)
Delete employee

updateSalaryByPercentage(double percent, double min, double max)
Salary update. Related to functionality 5.

getPayHistory(int empID)
Get pay stubs for employee sorted by most recent pay date.

getNewHiresByDateRange(Date start, Date end)
New hires report

getMonthlyTotalPayByTitle(int job_title_id, int month, int year)
Total pay for month by job title. HR Admin only

getMonthlyTotalPayByDivision(int div_ID, int month, int year)
Total pay for month by Division. HR Admin only.



***Due April 20th***

AuthenticationController.java

- Dependencies: DataAccessLayer.java, User.java
- Store Current logged-in user (session)
- Implement the following methods

Method
Purpose

login(String username, String password)
Validate credentials, create User object, store session

logout()
Clear current user

getCurrentUser()
Return current User object

getCurrentUserRole()
Return role as String (or Role enum)

isLoggedIn()
Check if user is authenticated

isHRAdmin()
Convenience method: returns true if role is HR_ADMIN



***Due April 21-22***

SearchController.java
- Dependencies: AuthenticationController.java, DataAccessLayer.java
- Important! After getting results, check user role to return different results based on the role. Consider limiting data (no sensitive information) for general employe.
- Implement search methods, add on as needed:

Method
Purpose

searchByEmpID(int empID)
Search by empID → returns Employee or null

searchByName(String name)
Search by name → returns List<Employee> related to functionality 4.

searchByDOB(Date dob)
Search by date of birth

searchBySSN(String ssn)
Search by SSN



EmployeeManagementController.java 
- Dependencies: AuthenticationController.java, DataAccessLayer.java
- Implement following CRUD operations:
- Every method must check isHRAdmin() before proceeding

Method
Purpose

addEmployee(Employee emp)
Insert new employee (check HR Admin role first)

updateEmployee(int empID, Employee newData)
Update existing employee

deleteEmployee(int empID)
Delete employee (with confirmation flow)



ReportGenerator.java
- Dependencies: AuthenticationController.java, DataAccessLayer.java
- Implement the following report methods:

Method
Purpose

getMyPayHistory()
For general employee – uses logged-in user's empID

getPayHistory(int empID)
For HR Admin – get any employee's pay history

  - General Employee Menu
  - HR Admin Menu
- Methods to implement:


***Due April 25th***

Main.java
Dependencies: UserInterface.java

***Optional Only If there is time:***

- Dependencies: All controller (same as UserInterface)
- You can only use Swing or JavaFx to help with this as specified in project instructions, no micro-frameworks that includes HTML, java script, Node.js, React, or Spring Boot.
- Same functionality as UserInterface but with windows/buttons
- Can reuse all controller classes, only the view changes
